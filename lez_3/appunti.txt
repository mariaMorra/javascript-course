/*
types and js:
any variable can hold any type of data
dynamic typing: we dont tell the jsengine what type of data a var contains
->it figures it out as code is run
_>any moment the type of a var can change
static typing: i say what type of thing is inside a var and it can hold values of that type alone (and subtypes of it obv if objoriented)
primitive types: there are 6; type of data that represents a single value (unlike an obj wich is made of name value pairs)
    >undefined= represents lack of existence
    >null= represents lack of existence but YOU can use it!
    >boolean= true/false
    >number= any number, it's a floating point number
    >string= sequence of characters
    >symbol= used in ES6 (next version of js) u can ignore it for now
