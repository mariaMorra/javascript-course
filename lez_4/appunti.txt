/*
OBJECT AND FUNCTIONS
the 2 are +++ RELATED, almost the same thing
*/

/*
object and the dot "." (operator)
an obj can have properties and methods
method= function connected to an object
Obj is in memory and has references to the addresses/space in memory where it's "parts" live
to access the parts themselves
    >x proprieta: 
        -computed member access operator : [] -> to set and access properties
        -object access operator (?) : . -> to set and access any part (?) 
    >x metodi: 
        -object access operator (?) : . -> to set and access any part (?) 
(prefer the . operator unless u need dynamic strings to access the searched property)
NB if u use it to CREATE a property be carefull of nesting
1) crea l'ggetto base
2) crea proprietà base
3) crea proprietà di oggetto proprietà
esempio persona.indirizzo.strada funziona solo se persona.indirizzo è GIA' creata con {} o new Object or wtvr else engine gets confused and gives back error

/*
OBJECT AND OBJECT LITERALS
an object created wt ={...} is an object literal
can be used anywhere, even as a parameter in a function call
*/

/*
framework aside : faking namespaces
namespace=container for variables and functions used to keep them separate from other wt the same name
but js does NOT have namespaces
=> objects can be used to simulate namespaces =)
*/

/*
object notation vs object literal
json HAS VERY SIMILAR SYNTAX but it expects all keys to be strings (wt "")
i can turn a normal obj lit into a valid json and all json is valid js obj:
    =>(JSON.stringify(objectLiteral)); // traduce da oggetto a string
    =>(JSON.stringify(jsonObjectLiteral)); // traduce da json a string
    =>var jsonvalue = JSON.parse('{"firstname" : "saklè","isAProgrammer" : false}'); //traduce da string a json / oggetto js
*/

/*
js concept: first class functions => FUNCTIONS ARE OBJECTS
first class functions: everything u CAN do wt other types u can do with FUNCTIONS: 
    >u can assign it to variables, 
    >pass them around as a parameter, 
    >create them on the fly ecc
a function is a special type of object, can have:
-associated primitives
-ass. objects
-ass. functions
but also:
-has name but it's optional, can be anonymous
-can have code (the code you write) => the code u write is a property of the function
it is NOT the function itself
->code is invocable, it can be run and create an exec context ecc
*/

/*
function statements and functions expressions
expressions: a unit of code that results in a value, not necessarily saved in a var;
statement: unit of code that does NOT return a value, it's just an action in the code
a function can be statements or values, 
the 2 can have the same code, but:
>the first can be called from anywhere in the parent, it is created but has no true home
>the second results in an object being created, the function itself, that can be assigned to a variable BUT CANNOT BE HOISTED!
*/

/*
"by value VS by reference"
talking about variables
    ->if i pass it by value then i get an new COPY
    ->if i pass by reference i have the address where the first variable hosts it's own value, we do NOT have a new location in memory
>if primitive type passing is done by value most usually
>if object normal passing is not by value, but by reference (shallow copy, we get two ALIASES TO THE SAME OBJECT)
